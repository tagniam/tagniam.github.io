# About

Hi.  
I'm J.R.  

I study computer science at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca).  
I studied abroad at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au).  

I recently worked as a software developer co-op at [RBC](https://www.rbc.com/canada.html).   
I actively contribute to the [open source community](https://github.com/tagniam).  

I use [Vim over Emacs](https://www.vim.org).  
I prefer [spaces over tabs](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/).

I sometimes [travel the world]({{ site.url }}/travel).  
I play [acoustic fingerstyle guitar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP_jMgvkI93rOTqyYQXaNQQ/videos).
